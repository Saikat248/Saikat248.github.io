Hi there, Welcome to my little corner in the internet !!!

I am a Ph.D Student under the Department of Chemistry, IIT Kharagpur. I am
working with Prof: [Anakuthil Anoop](http://www.chemistry.iitkgp.ac.in/~anoop/){:target="\_blank"}. My
broad area of interest is the computational study of complex reaction mechanism.

This site is currently under construction. (Still)
